# Dynamic-Gesture-Recognition

This repository contains code for my project - Dynamic Gesture Recognition.

All the required dependencies for this project can be found in the file requirements.txt 

## To execute the code, run the following command in the base directory :
```
python3 ./code/main.py
```
## Current Gestures Mapping:

The base mapping of gestures is as follows:

1. Swipe Left =========> Switch tabs

2. Swipe Right ========> Minimize current sab

3. Pulling Hand In =====> Minimize all tabs and return to desktop

4. Thumbs up Motion ===> Screenshot

## Future Work

I am currently working on improving performance and adding more gestures which wasn't done earlier due to computational constraints.
